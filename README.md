drinking-game-html
==================

Since an app we had on our phones keept crashing, no going back if accidently double tapping and such, I decided to build my own game app with thoose features.
And to support all plattforms we usually use (windows phone/os, android and iphone) I decided to write it in pure html, css and js to support them all.


Current roadmap:

  - v1 should contain
    - Possibility to set custom rules for each card (1-12)
    - Possibility to save thoose rules in a cookie for later use if something crashes or is closed down
    - Only pure html, css and js to ensure everything can be runned on devices (and "offline" from a SINGLE html file)
    - Next/previous card navigation
    - Ugly as fck graphic
    
  - future feauters (thoughts and so)
    - Custom rules for all cards and types (1-12 * 4 for diamond, spades, hearts and clubs)
    - Card counter (how many played/left and/or "king warning")
    - Sound effects? (technical limitations if should be available offline in a single html file?)
    - Cards that have "save"/"use" abilites?
    - Tracking of players
    - Help/info as a optional textarea to explain a certain card or rule
